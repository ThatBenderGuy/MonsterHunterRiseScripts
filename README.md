# Monster Hunter Rise REFramework Scripts
A simple repository for all my scripts plus faster updating with new features before Nexus

## How to use
Simply drag any of the main scripts into your reframework/autorun folder and copy the TBGHelperScripts folder to your autorun folder as well.

## What's next?
I'm currently looking into several other mods and will post progress here.
